Hi, thanks for taking time to look me up!

I am a multidisciplinary Computer Engineer with deep Linux experience in Cloud architectures, IoT-GPU fleet assembly, deployment, and management, as well as containerized, serverless, and edge-compute applications. Primarily writing TypeScript, but increasingly using Rust/WASM, Elixir, Golang, and NATS.  I am also familiarizing with tech cooperatives, Ethical and Responsible AI, and ML Ops architectures targeting IoT devices. 

If you are ever in Austin, letâ€™s get a coffee!
